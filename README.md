# Amazon Ui Task

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I was not able to login as the **task did not include any credentials to use**, and also when i tried to generate fake email to register-with, It needs a real phone number to send the OTP upon to be used in the login flow,
>  thus It was not possible to do such action in either the beginning of the flow or after putting all products in cart and trying to proceed.
